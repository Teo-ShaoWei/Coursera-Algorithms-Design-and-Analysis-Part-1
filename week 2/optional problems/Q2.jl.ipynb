    "You are given an $n$ by $n$ grid of distinct numbers. A number is a local minimum if it is smaller than all of its neighbors. (A neighbor of a number is one immediately above, below, to the left, or the right. Most numbers have four neighbors; numbers on the side have three; the four corners have two.) Use the divide-and-conquer algorithm design paradigm to compute a local minimum with only $O(n)$ comparisons between pairs of numbers. (Note: since there are $n^2$ numbers in the input, you cannot afford to look at all of them. Hint: Think about what types of recurrences would give you the desired upper bound.)"

    "The crux is to cut a line of number around the middle of the grid to divide into halves. If there is a local minimum among this number, we are done. Else, there are smaller number among the neighbours of the line of number. Pick the half with the smallest number. Repeat the procedure, this time dividing into 2 smaller squarish halves. Eventually the process has to stop, and we will reach a local minimum."
